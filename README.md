# PoE_Forum_parser
It's a simple parser. I've made it to practice my skills. It's based on library "BeautifulSoup". You can test it and use as to practice your skills in parsing.  
This parser includes Paginator, to simplify the process but the structure can easily be imporved.
The problem I faced with was the difference between even/odd themes because of their names and positions.
That made me to create 2 linereaders to group it together.
